PÃ  amb Tomaquet

INGREDIENTS
12x1 cm/1/2 in thick slices country-style bread
3 cloves garlic, halved (optional)
6 soft, vine-ripened tomatoes
olive oil
salt
paper-thin slices cured ham (optional)

DIRECTIONS
Toast the bread under a hot grill or on a barbecue grid over glowing coals.
While warm, rub each slice on one side with a cut garlic clove.
Halve the tomatoes crosswise and rub each side of the toast with a tomato half, allowing the juice, seeds and pulp to soak into the bread.
Pour on a little olive oil and season with salt. Serve topped with ham if desired.

NOTES
This is a very typical dish from Catalonia, one of the autonomous regions of Spain. It's usually served with cured ham or with a great variety of cold meats and it can be eaten at any time of the day :)
Enjoy !!!
